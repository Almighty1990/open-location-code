        <p>Open Location Codes are a way of encoding location into a form that is
easier to use than latitude and longitude. They are designed to be used 
like street addresses, especially in places where buildings aren't numbered 
or streets aren't named.</p>
<h2 style="color: #007edf;"><a name="plus-codes" class="anchor" href="#plus-codes"></a>New project site!</h2>
<p>
  We have a new site for information about the project, <a href="https://plus.codes">plus.codes</a>.
</p>
<p>
  For information on the code, or to create an issue, carry on to our <a href="https://github.com/google/open-location-code">github project</a>.

<h2><a name="stop-giving-directions" class="anchor" href="#stop-giving-directions"></a>Stop giving directions</h2>

<p>Instead of giving people complicated directions, just give them a short code 
that tells them exactly where you want them to go. They can enter it in their
phone, laptop, computer, and get the exact location. They don't even need to
be online!</p>

<p>
  Most places just need a six character code and a locality to get an accurate,
  unique reference. For example, this 
  <a href="https://www.google.ch/maps/@-19.9533761,-43.9651734,255m/data=!3m1!1e3">football pitch</a>
  in Belo Horizonte, Brazil has the location "Belo Horizonte 22WM+PW". Try it on
  the <a href="http://plus.codes/58GR22WM+PW">demo site</a>!
</p>
<p>
  If you don't want to use the locality, you can use the full 10 character code. That
  same football pitch has the full reference 58GR22WM+PW. "58GR" is like an area code
  of a telephone number, and like an area code, if you're in the town (or even near it)
  you don't need it.
</p>


<h2>
<a name="who-could-use-it" class="anchor" href="#who-could-use-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are these codes for?</h2>

<p>Here are three examples of people who could use these codes.</p>

<p>
  People living in unmapped slum areas, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibera">Kibera</a> in Nairobi, could
  use these codes as a home or business address. For example, the Adventure Crafts Glassmart in Kibera has the address
  "Stall No.164, Makina Stalls, Kibera Dr, Kibera, Located close to the Toi Market". That's not easy to find, and the
  glass they ordered might be delivered late if at all. But if
  they tell the delivery company that their address was "MQPQ+QG Kibera", they can 
  <a href="http://plus.codes/6GCRMQPQ+QG">look it up</a>, get the exact location, and the glass will
  be delivered faster.
</p>

<p>Small businesses rely on people being able to find them. This is especially true for guest houses, because they
  are mostly used by people who are not local to the area. If a guest house provides their location using these codes,
  a visitor is able to use that code to go directly to the location.
</p>

<p>
  Crisis response organisations need accurate location information. These may be existing buildings (storage warehouses)
  or things such as wells that don't have addresses, or temporary camps that could be long distances from the nearest
  road. Latitude and longitude coordinates are long and prone to errors, leading to wasted time and resources. Using
  short codes that importantly, do not require expensive satellite communications, could provide such organisations with
  improved location information.

<p>Of course. The codes are free to get and free to decode. We've got software
libraries on our Github site, and example web pages. If you need help, you can
contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-location-code">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="thats-so-cool-can-i-help" class="anchor" href="#thats-so-cool-can-i-help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>That's so cool! Can I help?</h2>

<p>Yes! We are working on implementations in other languages, but if you'd like
to do an implementation, contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-location-code">mailing list</a>
and see if anyone else is already working on the language.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you know someone who would be interested, let them know.</p>

<a name="why-didnt-you-just-use-x" class="anchor" href="#why-didnt-you-just-use-x"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why didn't you just use X?</h2>

<p>The first thing we did was to work out what attributes of addresses were useful.
Once we had that list, we looked at a lot of existing location coding methods to
see how well they matched our list. Once we'd done that, we decided that it was worth
to at least define a new one, and then see if it was well received.</p>

<p>The other methods were mostly designed with different ideas in mind, and
so this isn't a criticism of them.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-makes-open-location-codes-different" class="anchor" href="#what-makes-open-location-codes-different"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What makes Open Location Codes different?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The codes aren't case sensitive and don't include easily confused characters. We've selected the
characters to make it difficult to impossible to spell words in any language.</li>
<li>Codes are generated from latitude and longitude, so they already exist for everywhere. Nobody has to
set them up or pay for them. Each place has only one code.</li>
<li>Codes that are similar are located closer together than codes that are different.</li>
<li>Open Location Codes represent an area, not a point.</li>
<li>The size of the area depends on the length of the code. Long codes are more accurate than short
codes.</li>
<li>Dropping characters from the end of a code gives you a larger area that contained the original code.</li>
<li>Codes are 10 or 11 characters long (<em>8FMGP9FW+6M</em>), but if you're in the local area (within 50km),
the leading four characters of the code can be omitted (<em>P9FW+6M</em>) making the codes even shorter.</li>
<li>The short code can be used together with a place name (like <em>P9FW+6M Pisa, Italy</em>).</li>
</ul>
